#Repository (Repo): A repository is a collection of files and directories associated with a project, along with the version history of each file. Git repositories can be either local (stored on your computer) or remote (stored on a server).

#Commit: A commit is a snapshot of changes made to the repository at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier (hash) and includes information such as the author, timestamp, and a message describing the changes.

#Branch: A branch is a separate line of development within a repository. Branches allow developers to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase (usually called the "master" or "main" branch). Once changes in a branch are tested and approved, they can be merged back into the main branch.
